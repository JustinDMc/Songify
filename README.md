# Welcome to Songify, a project I worked on while a student at the Flatiron School.

Songify was made to showcase my ability with creating a robust API modeled backend, using Ruby on Rails, Postgres and ActiveRecord, and tying that together with a React front end. 
  
Within the client folder you'll find the src folder, and within there you will find my React components. 

The backend models, controllers, and routes can be found within the app folder. 

All complex seed data can be found within the db folder, in the seeds.rb file.
